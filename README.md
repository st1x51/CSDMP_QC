# CSDMP for PSP
Its a homebrew for PSP,which is similar to a Counter Strike Combined Assault game by StealthKill,but with many new features.
Code for this game was rewritten from c++ to qc, i took parts from regamelite project.

Last build can be found here:https://yadi.sk/d/1IuIrSZ-tTXyC
But its not actual,because this game is based on CSCA code with DQuake engine.
