/*QUAKED func_ladder (0 .5 .8) ?
Creates an invisible trigger area that the player can "climb" vertically.

Dependant on additions in client.qc, and player.qc

The movement was initially intended to mimic ladders in RTCW, but there
are some differences due to QuakeC limitations, and personal preference
(jumping behaviour and speed can easily be changed).

"angle" The direction the player must be facing in order to climb
"targetname" use as a killtarget to delete the ladder
DISABLED: "target" Attach the ladder to a func_train_ext

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:
- up/down keys don't climb (only way is to use MOVETYPE_FLY, which means current touch code is useless)
- DISABLED: physics break when the player is trying to move in the same direction as a ladder's parent train

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USEAGE NOTES:

These work best when they are at least 8 units thick.

Make sure the angle is set correctly. All movement revolves around the ladder's
facing angle. (Remember: It's the angle the PLAYER must be facing to climb)

The top of the func_ladder brush should be flush with the top of the ledge (if the
ladder leads to a ledge). Ladders behave as if there's an 8 unit "step" at the top.

It's a good idea to back these up with a solid brush or a clipping brush.
Especially if using real geometry for the rungs. (i.e. to fill the gaps between the rungs)

If you need a "two-way" ladder (like a ladder hanging from a fire-escape) use a clip
brush in the middle, and two func_ladders on either end with opposite facing angles.

Avoid situations where more than one func_ladder can be touched at the same time.
